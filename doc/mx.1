.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create siloed tmux(1) sessions for your projects\. It will \'auto\-launch\' projects for you, so long as it can find them based on the arguments that you provide\.
.
.P
\fBmx\fR will attempt to interperet the provided arguments in the following order:
.
.TP
\fBmx\fR \fIsession\fR
Reattach to a pre\-existing tmux session with the provided name\. This is the equivalent of running \fBtmux attach \-t <session>\fR, but much more short and convenient\.
.
.TP
\fBmx\fR \fIproject\fR
If \fIproject\fR is a directory inside your <~/Projects> directory, this command will spawn and attach to a new tmux session named \fIproject\fR in that directory\. It will set up a workspace inside the session according to the rules described in the \fBSETUP\fR section below\.
.
.TP
\fBmx\fR \fIpath\fR
If \fIpath\fR references a directory, this command will spawn and attach to a new tmux session in that directory, and it will be named after the basename(1) of \fIpath\fR\. It will set up a workspace inside the session according to the rules described in the \fBSETUP\fR section below\.
.
.TP
\fBmx\fR \fIsession\fR
If none of the above rules apply, it will spawn a new tmux sessin in the current working directory with the name of \fIsession\fR\. The workspace will be created according to the rules described in the \fBSETUP\fR section below\.
.
.SH "SETUP"
If the target directory has a <\.tmux> file, that file will be executed instead of the default window setup\. An example <\.tmux> file is listed in the next section\.
.
.P
If there is no <\.tmux> file, then it will open two windows by default\. Here are the windows:
.
.TP
\fBeditor\fR
The editor defined by the \fI$EDITOR\fR environment variable\.
.
.TP
\fBshell\fR
A default shell\.
.

.br
